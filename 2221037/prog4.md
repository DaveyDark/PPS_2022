## Program 4: Write a program to display operators in C

```C
#include<stdio.h>

//Program to demonstrate operators

int main(){
	int a=50,b=5;

	printf("A = %d\n B = %d\n\n",a,b);
	printf("A + B = %d (Addition Operator)\n",a+b);
	printf("A - B = %d (Subtraction Operator\n",a-b);
	printf("A * B = %d (Multiplication Operator)\n",a*b);
	printf("A / B = %d (Division Operator)\n",a/b);
	printf("A mod B = %d (Remainder operator)\n",a%b);

	return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
A = 50 B = 5

A + B = 55 (Addition Operator)
A - B = 45 (Subtraction Operator
A * B = 250 (Multiplication Operator)
A / B = 10 (Division Operator)
A mod B = 0 (Remainder operator)
```
